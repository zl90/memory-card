This project was created with React JS using functional components and hooks.

## Overview
I built this app to get familiar with the following concepts:
- React - using React Hooks (useEffect and useState).
- React - Organising React components into maintainable heirarchies.
- Using [MUI](https://mui.com/), a Component library for React
- [Deploying](https://medium.com/@isharamalaviarachchi/how-to-deploy-your-react-app-into-github-pages-b2c96292b18e) React apps to Github Pages

### Tech used
- Javascript
- Webpack
- npm
- Prettier + ESLint
- ![MUI](https://mui.com/)
- ![React JS](https://reactjs.org/) Hooks
- ![uniqid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid) (Generating unique keys for lists of React Components)

## Lessons learned
- I learned it's really important to plan and draw a Component hierarchy before starting a project. My last React project was very disorganised and it was difficult to work with. This time I wrote down a Component tree before I wrote any code, which greatly improved my workflow.
- I found that working with Functional Components is much easier than using Class Components.
